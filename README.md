# XFacebook
XFacebook Browser Extension
# Features
XFacebook has three features:
1. Blacklist (hide posts with particular words in them)
2. Hide Likes (hides all of those pesky posts that show up on your timeline saying "Random Friend liked this")
3. Safe Stalking (removes the like, comment, and share buttons when you are on someone's timeline so you won't accidentally like their year-old posts)

2. Go to Google Chrome's "Extensions" tab
3. Check the "developer mode" box
