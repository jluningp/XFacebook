# Features
XFacebook has three features: </br>

2. Hide Likes (hides all of those pesky posts that show up on your timeline saying "Random Friend liked this") </br>
3. Safe Stalking (removes the like, comment, and share buttons when you are on someone's timeline so you won't accidentally like their year-old posts)
